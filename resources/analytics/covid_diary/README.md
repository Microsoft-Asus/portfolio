COVID-19 (nCov - New Coronavirus) is highly sensitive to temperature differences. 
High temperatures and vapor reduce the transmissibility and environmental stability of the virus.
Doing something as cheap and easy as taking some water vapor every day can help reduce/stop it's spread.

Be careful and don't do this if you are not an adult.
