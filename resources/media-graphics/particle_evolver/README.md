**Particle Evolver**

- Here a demo video -> https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KKQdl02EDwRZ2B1Ubc1uDex1aFy5cKrA    (Sound is awful) [EDIT AUDIO]

This windows application uses combinations of particles with different characteristics:
- Shape
- Initial shape size
- Ending shape size
- Rotational speed at start
- Rotational speed at start
- Selfrotational speed at start
- Selfrotational speed at end
- Alpha at start
- Alpha at end
- Blending at start
- Blending at end
- Initial color
- Middle color
- Ending color
- Generate sons when lifetime runs out
- Lifetime
- X width at start
- X with at end
- Y width at start
- Y width at end
- .... a few more i don't remember.

- Hitting a key would display a menu in which user could vote with stars from 1 to 5 about how much he liked the actual set appearence.
- Depending on the number of stars, those characteristics would be shifted slighly or not or even totally erased when very few stars. 
- Some thresholds would be adjusted for those ranges in which one star was given so after a couple of times very extreme ranges would be
- be discarded forever.

- Then it would display everything as the background of the desktop.
- I found quite problematic to do :
    - Using multiple monitors with different resolutions and not always symmetric, horizontal/vertical monitors configurations and having all the coordinates still centered. I only tested up to 3 monitors.
    - Windows background with actual explorer.exe 's icons, windows, etc working on top. At the end seems to be running fine.
